# Privacy Policy

## We will respect and protect your privacy

### We promise:

* Your data belongs to you.
* We will never sell or share your private information with a third party without your agreement (unless we are required to do so by law).
* None of our staff will look at your private information, unless it's to fix an issue in the system.
* Our staff all sign agreements to keep your data confidential.
* You can delete your data from our systems (unless we are required to keep it by law or for audit purposes).

### In using Good-Loop, you agree:

* You authorise Good-Loop to store information relating to your account, including the use of browser cookies.
* Anonymous data is OK. We can use data from your account in anonymised analysis, and the results belong to us. For example, we might produce a report for the charities, helping them understand the pattern of donations.
* Whilst you are a user, you authorise Good-Loop to use data from your account within our services.
* We can contact you as part of the services we supply, e.g. to tell you about new features.
* If you submit content to a public part of the site then you grant us an open licence to use, reproduce, adapt and publish that content. An example would be posting a public comment on a blog we host. This does not affect private content, which remains private.

For integration with Facebook, Twitter or similar networks, Good-Loop may ask you to authorise access to sites.
Where possible, we use a system called OAuth where you don't have to give us your password (so it's more secure and gives you better control). You can revoke OAuth access for specific apps at any point. E.g. for Twitter, you do that at http://twitter.com/account/connections.
